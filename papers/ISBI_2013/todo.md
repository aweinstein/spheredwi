## Writing

- Change from CVXOPT to scikit-learn, add link
- Describe direction finding (using new version in dipy?)
- Squeeze middle text, expand discussion and introduction
- Work on references...formating, etc. 
- Write killer abstract!
- Have Fernando proof read

## Reproducibility & coding

- Create notebook
- Create script to generate paper webpage
  Link to paper + IPython notebook
- Implement source code display in JS
- Convert to new direction-finding API in DiPy

## Graphics

- Comparison plot, Tristan-Vega, Tuch, Aganj, ours
- Kernel: ODF vs Q-space
- Add axes to kernel and q-space kernel plots
  That way people see that it's lined up with the corresponding point on the
  sphere
