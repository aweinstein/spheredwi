# Modelling of diffusion imaging signals

## Project overview

We aim to model diffusion MRI signals to achieve accurate reconstruction of the
orientation density function (ODF).  Current work is mostly based on Q-ball
imaging, using sparse fits of different classes of kernel functions to robustly
model the signal, reject noise, and detect fiber crossings.

## Software

The software in this repository builds on [DiPy][].
